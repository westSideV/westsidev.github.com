<h2> 1.Malware/Advertisement/Spam </h2>
Any sort of link or image that can cause hardware/software malfunction or any sensitive content. </br>
Spam isn't allowed on the West-side discord's channels. This means you cannot use our text channels to repeatedly post the same thing, to have attention or annoy other players. Especially on the ticket channel you must wait your turn and time, while the support team studies the situation and brings the best decision possible.
